<h2 align="center">Goals and Accomplishments</h2>
Let's Cook is a full-stack web app. I wanted to create a place where users could post their favorite recipes, search for new recipes, and save their favorite recipes to a collection that they could easily find. Users can like, save, and comment on recipes, as well as delete recipes from their favorites that they may not want to keep saved.

<h2 align="center">Optimizations</h2>

Optimized this to fit all screen sizes as best as possible. The goal was for the user to have a fluid experience on all their devices. Designed with mobile-first in mind.
